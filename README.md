# Javascript Practice with ToDo App
We are creating a ToDo App that allows a user to add a new item to a list, mark an item on the list as completed and delete an item.

# How to start
You can either unzip the files or clone the repository on github

## Unzip files
Navigate to where you want to add these files on your computer. Then click on the files to unzip them.

## Clone the Repository
Open VSCode, Then go to Terminal --> New Terminal 
Once the terminal is open, use the link below to clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/STEM-ENRG/javascript_practice.git`

> Note: If you set up SSH, then use the ssh link: git@github.com:STEM-ENRG/javascript_practice.git

# Open the files in VSCode
If you've unzipped the files, then follow the instructions from unzip. If you cloned then follow the clone instructions

## Unzip
Open VSCode and Click Open and choose the folder where you placed the unzipped files in

## Clone
@todo:
I think you may have to open again in VSCode? Test this out

Change to the directory where the files are: `cd javascript_practice`

Make sure you have 7 files in your directory: `ls`
There should be 7 files listed after running this command

# Start

Open the index.html file in the browser: In the terminal, type this command: 

Mac: `open index.html` 

Windows: `start index.html`

> **Note** You only have to do this once to launch in the browser. Afterwards, you only need to refresh the page in order to see the new changes.

In VSCode: Click on the `script.js` file. You can also open the other files but the javascript file contains the instructions you need to complete this. 

You will notice there are Step by Step comments in the `script.js` file that will help you complete the application. If you get stuck, I've included a Javascript_Cheatsheet.md file and Javascript_Cheatsheet.pdf file to help you with the definitions of the things used in the script.js code

If you have further questions, let me know.

After opening the page in the browser, you should also open the console in the browser. 

In the browser: right click --> Select Inspect --> Select Console from the panel

This is what you should see:

# Checkpoints
There are a few checkpoints included while you complete the steps so that you can confirm that you are on the right track. Those checkpoint images are included in this section.
